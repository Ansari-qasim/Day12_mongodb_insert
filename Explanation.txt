How data is inserted into MongoDB using Mongoose:
Mongoose provides a high-level abstraction to interact with MongoDB. To insert data:

Define a schema.

Create a model.

Instantiate a model object with data.

Use .save() to insert it into MongoDB.

ðŸ”¹ Role of Mongoose Models:
Models are wrappers around schemas. They represent collections in MongoDB and provide methods like .save(), .find(), etc., to interact with the database.
